# D-Bus session bus activation file for rosecd.
#
# Install to: ~/.local/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.secrets.service
#
# This causes the session bus to start rosecd (via systemd) when any client
# first accesses org.freedesktop.secrets, rather than requiring an explicit
# exec-once in the compositor config.
#
# The SystemdService= key delegates activation to systemd instead of exec-ing
# rosecd directly — systemd handles restarts, logging, and sandboxing.
# Requires the rosecd.service systemd user unit to be installed and enabled.
#
# If you are not using systemd, remove the SystemdService= line and ensure
# rosecd is started via XDG autostart or compositor exec-once instead.
