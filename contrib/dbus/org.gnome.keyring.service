# This file masks the system-level gnome-keyring D-Bus activation entry
# for the org.gnome.keyring name, preventing it from auto-starting when
# rosecd already owns org.freedesktop.secrets.
#
# Install to: ~/.local/share/dbus-1/services/org.gnome.keyring.service
# (user-level service files take precedence over /usr/share/dbus-1/services/)
#
# The Exec=/bin/false means any attempt to auto-activate org.gnome.keyring
# will fail immediately rather than launching gnome-keyring-daemon.
